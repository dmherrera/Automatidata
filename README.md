# Project Name: NYC Taxi Fare Estimation Model

Automatidata collaborates with clients to transform their unused and stored data into valuable solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, and strategic business insights. We specialize in identifying business needs and leveraging data to meet those needs.

## Project Description

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The TLC has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model to estimate taxi fares before the ride, utilizing data gathered by the TLC.

### Objectives:
- **Develop a regression model**: Create an accurate model to estimate taxi fares before the ride.
- **Leverage TLC data**: Utilize extensive data from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day.
- **Meet business needs**: Provide valuable insights and tools to enhance the efficiency and satisfaction of NYC's taxi services.

### Impact:
A successful fare estimation model will help TLC provide more accurate fare predictions, improving the user experience for both drivers and passengers. This will enable better planning, budgeting, and overall satisfaction with NYC taxi services.

Join us in this project to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of taxi fare estimations in New York City.
